I can see from the terminal output that there are many ESLint warnings and errors that need to be fixed. Let me analyze the issues and fix them systematically.

The main categories of issues are:
1. **Unused variables/imports** - Many `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` warnings
2. **Unescaped entities** - Many `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors for apostrophes and quotes
3. **Empty object types** - `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object` errors
4. **Missing dependencies** - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings
5. **HTML link usage** - `@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages` errors

Let me start by fixing the most critical errors first, then work on the warnings. I'll begin with the unescaped entities errors since they're causing actual errors.

Could not find file 'app/auth/profile-setup/page.tsx' in the workspace.

---

Read file: frontend/app/auth/profile-setup/page.tsx

I can see the issue is on line 246 where there's an unescaped apostrophe in "You're". Let me fix this and also check for the unused variable warning around line 319.

Read file: frontend/app/auth/profile-setup/page.tsx

Now let me fix both issues in this file:
